# Scripts

Convenience shell wrappers for launching notebook-driven workflows in batch mode.

- `run_finetune_slice.sh`: executes the fine-tuning notebook for a specific temporal slice and replay condition.
- `run_attacks.sh`: runs the evaluation + attack notebooks sequentially.
- `export_figures.sh`: regenerates publication figures from saved metrics.

Update the scripts once runtime paths and credentials are finalized.
